parameters :
    fba_id :
        ui-name : |
            FBA
        short-hint : |
            Name of the Flux Balance Analysis to be analysed
        long-hint  : |
            The FBA object that is related to the selected Model and assoicated Expression data.

    expression_series_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Data Set
        short-hint : |
            Name of the Expression Data Set
        long-hint  : |
            The Expression Matrix is related to the selected Model and assoicated FBA. The data is from expression matrix will be normalized and rank to a scale of 0 to 1.

    expression_condition :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Condition
        short-hint : |
            Name of the Expression Condition. Condition in the first row will be used by default if left blank
        long-hint  : |
            An Expression Matrix may have multiple expression coditions listed. If left blank, expression condition in the first row will be used by default.

    expression_cutoff :
        ui-name : |
            Expression threshold
        short-hint : |
            Expression threshold value. 0.4 is used by default if left blank
        long-hint  : |
            All genes above the mentioned threshold be considered as expessed. 0.4 is ued by default.

	<p>This method takes a FBA model, a FBA and a related expression data set inorder to evaluate how well the expression data fit with the FBA.</p>
